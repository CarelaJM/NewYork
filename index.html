            <a class="bold">Hotel Chantelle</a> <br> Not actually a hotel, Ravi Patel's LES spot is named after a French World War II safe house. Hotel Chantelle is retro in design as unmarked doors transport you into Patel's version of 1940's Paris. The room exudes warmth as dark mahogany wood panels blend with the black leather pin tucked banquettes under the glow of flickering exposed bulbs, candles, and a gold floral pattern that bounces off dark wallpaper.

            <a class="bold">Highlight room</a> <br> Perched 16 stories above the intersection of Broome and Bowery, The Highlight Room is a glamorous rooftop bar that evokes a 19th-century pleasure garden, with a majestic tree spreading its branches across the room and outdoor terrace. Encased in glass windows on all sides, The Highlight Room offers unparalleled views of the New York skyline and a festive atmosphere perfect for any occasion.
